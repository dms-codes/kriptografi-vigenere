# Vigenère Cipher Encryption

This Python script performs Vigenère cipher encryption on a given plaintext message using a provided keyword.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext messages using the Vigenère cipher with a user-defined keyword.
- Supports uppercase letters.
- Preserves spaces and special characters in the input message.
- Repeats the keyword as needed to match the length of the plaintext message.

## Usage

1. Modify the `keyword` and `plaintext` variables with the keyword and message you want to encrypt.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

3. The script will perform the encryption and print the ciphertext.

## Example

Suppose you have the following lines of code in your script:

```python
keyword = 'VIGENERE'
plaintext = 'SELAMATDATANGDIKELASKRIPTOGRAFIYA'
```

After running the script, you will see the following output:

```
CIPCVHVWMJAZWUVRGMIUBTZYSPIK
```
